# ASD gene Bcl11a regulates subcellular RNA localization, associative circuitry, and social behavior
RNA-seq and variant calling of CPN somata and GCs that are wild-type, Bcl11a-het, or Bcl11a-null.

GEO contains all raw (fastq inputs), processed (HaplotypeCaller and FeatureCount outputs), and metadata files: 

To turn raw files into processed files, use the scripts in bcl11a_fastqs_to_counts_and_variants, following the instructions in workflow.txt. 

R markdowns for data analysis and visualization of processed files are in bcl11a_analysis_and_visualization.
